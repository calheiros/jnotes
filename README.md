# Jnotes

Simple notepad app built using Flutter.

# About

This app features a simple and intuitive interface for creating, editing, and deleting notes, with support for basic text formatting such as bold, italic, and underline. The app utilizes SQLite database to store notes and integrates with the device's share feature, making it easy to share your notes with others  as text file.

I created this app as a learning project for myself, however if you're just starting out or looking to improve your skills, this app is a great resource for learning how to build a fully functional notepad app using Flutter.
